It was the middle of the night and Ayal Lanternari was rushing to warm up refrigerated breast milk for his three-month-old baby.His son, Daniel, was hungry and there was nothing Lanternari could do to speed up the process. The only safe way to heat up cold or frozen breast milk is by putting it under running warm water or in a bowl of warm water — a process that can take 10 minutes or more."You can't microwave breast milk or heat it directly on the stove because it will damage the nutrients and the immunological property in the milk," says Lanternari, a biomedical engineer.But like most new parents, he was tired and frustrated, and thought there had to be a better way. That's when he got an idea: What if he designed a baby bottle that spread out the breast milk into a thinner layer? Doing that would expand the liquid's surface area, allowing it to warm up faster without damaging the nutrients."The bottle kind of designed itself in my head," said Lanternari.Read MoreNanobébé now employs 30 people and its bottle has won a number of industry awards, including TTPM [Toys, Tots, Pets &amp; Mom] Best of Baby Award for 2018.
