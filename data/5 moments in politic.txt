The holidays, however, are a time to be hopeful. As the second year of the Trump administration comes to a close, here are five moments from this year's political news that everyone can find something to smile about, no matter your political leaning.1. Michelle Obama and George W. Bush's friendship5. High Election Day turnoutVoters turned out in record numbers this year, with an estimated 118 million people turning out to cast their ballots in the 2018 midterms.In the last midterm elections in 2014, just 36.7% of the eligible voting population cast ballots. In 2018, the number jumped to an estimated 50.1% turnout of the voting eligible population."With Trump likely to be on the ballot in 2020, don't be surprised if that election also features high turnout," CNN's Harry Enten wrote about the high turnout.
