Carrie Fisher's daughter, actress Billie Lourd, honored her mom with a song on the two-year anniversary of her death. "It has been two years since my Momby's death and I still don't know what the 'right' thing to do on a death anniversary is (I'm sure a lot of you feel the same way about your loved ones). So I decided to do something a little vulnerable for me, but something we both loved to do together - sing," Lourd wrote in an emotional Instagram post, which was accompanied by a video.  Fisher died on December 27, 2016 of undetermined causes after suffering a cardiac event on a flight from London to Los Angeles.

So I decided to do something a little vulnerable for me, but something we both loved to do together - sing. This is the piano her father gave her and this was one of her favorite songs. And as the song says, we must "keep on moving". I've found that what keeps me moving is doing things that make me happy, working hard on the things that I'm passionate about and surrounding myself with people I love and making them smile. I hope this encourages anyone feeling a little low or lost to "keep on moving". As my Momby once said, "take your broken heart and turn it into art" - whatever that art may be for you. ❤️ A post shared by  Billie Lourd (@praisethelourd) on Dec 26, 2018 at 9:36pm PST The video posted by Lourd featured her take on the song "These Days," a Jackson Browne-penned tune that was made famous by Nico and covered by many others.
