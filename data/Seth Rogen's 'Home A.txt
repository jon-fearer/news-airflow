Seth Rogen's mind has just been blown.Rogen has been rewatching holiday classics in recent days, and he was shocked to learn that the black and white movie Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) watches in "Home Alone" was never actually made."My entire childhood, I thought the old timey movie that Kevin watches in Home Alone (Angels With Filthy Souls) was actually an old movie," Rogen tweeted.
"Angels with Even Filthier Souls," shown in "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," was also fake.Sometimes ignorance really is bliss.
